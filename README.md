Task: Emotion_classification

Emotion Classification using Machine learning/statistical method:

1.i have imported all the libraries and spacy library 
2. LOading the all four emotions dataset
3. preprocess all the data
4. then I have used wordcloud to see frequent words
5. after pre-processing of all the text I have used tfidf vectorizer to convert all the text into vectors based on the term frequency.
6. I have checked misisng values,data balance,dataset description
7. then I have saved vectorized datafrane for model building
8. then I have used ML classification to predict Emotion
9. I split vectors into train and test data
10. I have used Decision Tree,Random forest,K Nearest Neighnours,Naive Bayes,Support Vector machine,Extreme Gradient Boosting for classification.
11. Among all the Algorithms Random Forest model is the best model and this is the Final model for prediction
12. due to dimentionality reduction I have used PCA(Principal Component Analysis)
13. for regression I have used Linear Regression,support vector machine,XG boost,random forest and metrics is Mean squared Error
14. among all the algorithms Linear Regression model is giving good results 
15. saving the model


Emotion Classification using deep learning model:

1.importing dependencies
2.LOading the all four emotions dataset
3. preprocess all the data
4. then I have used wordcloud to see frequent words
5. after pre-processing of all the text I have used tfidf vectorizer to convert all the text into vectors based on the term frequency.
6. then split all the vectors into train and test
7. I have used CNN model 
8. then compile the model with metrics and loss
9. fit the data into CNN model
10. I have used r2_score and mean_squared_error as a metrics
11. I have saved the model
